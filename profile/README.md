## Hi there! Let me tell you how Librarian was bornðŸ‘‹

I'm not a librarian and I do not work in or even in education, but my mother is a teacher in my hometown.

As a developer, I was frustrated to find that my hometown schools are not using software to handle library books. So I decided to develop a simple but cool software for them.

And of course I called some friends to help me with this project. So, to them, my thanks: AndrÃ© Gava and Rafael de Paula.
